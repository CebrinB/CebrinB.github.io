      <h1>Notes</h1>
      <p>My notes for this week were one of the files I lost while trying to 
      clean up my GitHub repository. Oops. I emailed you about it. I had written 
      a simple story editor program that allowed the user to post short stories 
      then search posted stories by keyword. It was one of the examples from the 
      book.
