    <p>Notes:</p>
    <p>This week I studied about referencing the current object using 'this'. I learned about the prompt()
      function which I had not used previously. It is cool that with one function I can alert() and ask 
      for a response. I am familiar with objects in c++ but haven't made much use of them in javascript yet
      so I am learning a lot of new things! 
    </p>
    <p>Buttons on this page are my attempt at the exercise,
      <a href="practice.html"> this</a>
     is the solution from the book. Wow, so much more elegant! I have a lot to learn! Good practice though,
    and I do understand what is going on in the solution code.</p>
