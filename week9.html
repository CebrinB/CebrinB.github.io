  <p>The data- attribute is my favorite thing about the Browser Object Model. I love that I can store any
     information I want in any element by creating an attribute for it. We used it in our team challenge 
     this week to store a counter for keeping track of how many times a button had been pressed.</p>
  <p>JSON is <i>so cool</i>. Flattening an object so you can transfer it without worrying about scope 
    and preserving the object in memory is awesome. Coming from my C++ background, JavaSCript has some 
    interesting shortcuts/shorthand. 'audio' and 'video' tags are highly useful and made our team assignment 
    very easy. </p>
