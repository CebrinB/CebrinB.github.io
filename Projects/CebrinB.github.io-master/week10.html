  <h1>Notes</h1>
  <p>I think the reading this week was a little over my head. I understand the basics of using fetch() requests 
    but I think i will need some practice to be comfortable with different applications of the interface. 
    </p><p>This is important because I will need it for my Block 2 app!</p>
    <p>We had some trouble with our 'quakes' team challenge because we don't have any earthquakes near us in Texas 
      so we thought it wasn't working for a while.</p>
