  <h1>Week 7</h1>
  <section>
    <p><b>Notes</b></p>
    <p>The reading this week was fascinating, especially the linked extras about function hoisting, callback hell, etc. 
      I am learning a lot in this class, and enjoying javascript more than I did before. I'm still fuzzy about how to 
      structure my files. It seems that there should be a simple rule to follow when 'importing' classes but I haven't 
      found it yet in the book, or on the internet. It seems like I might just have to learn by doing what works and 
      what doesn't. Still having a great time in this course.
