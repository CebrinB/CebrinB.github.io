    <p>Notes:</p>
    <p>I updated my onclick properties to eventListeners in js. I like how they work. The book says
      to use the 'click' event to be compatible with both touch- and non-touchscreens, but the 
      directions for our team activity this week specifically say to use a 'touch' listener. It is
      interesting the difference between developing for mobile vs. desktop computing. I am 
      interested to see how it works differently in our team activity. </p>
    <link>I was late getting my Sitepoint membership and didn't start reading the book until last week. 
      This week, I began the 'quiz ninja' project from the book chapters. You can see my progress
      <a href="quizNinja.html"> by clicking here.</a> The onyl thing I did differently than the book
      so far is I wrapped the game logic in a game() function that loads after the html so that 
      the page loads before the game alerts pop up. 
    </p>
    <p>Most of what I have read is a review so far. The only thing I studied closely as being new is
       the different ways of declaring a function. I will keep practicing with those to better 
       understand the differences between them.
